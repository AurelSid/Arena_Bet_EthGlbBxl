# 🎮 ArenaBet - ETHGlobal Brussels 2024 Hackathon 🏆  

ArenaBet is a decentralized betting platform built with **Solidity**, leveraging **Riot Games APIs** to let users bet on eSports tournaments and matches and earn rewards. This project was developed as part of the **ETHGlobal Brussels 2024 Hackathon** and serves as a **proof of concept (MVP)** for a scalable Web3 betting system.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This is a hackathon project and is **not production-ready**. The code **has not been audited** and may contain security vulnerabilities. Do not use this platform with real funds.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🏅 **Bet on eSports Tournaments** – Powered by Riot Games APIs  
- 💰 **Earn Rewards** – Win rewards based on match outcomes  
- 🔗 **Built on Solidity** – A decentralized approach to eSports betting  
- 🎨 **Modern UI with Next.js & React** – Smooth and intuitive front-end experience  
- 🚀 **Scalable Design** – Can be expanded beyond Riot Games to include other tournaments and games  

## 📌 Tech Stack  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity  
- **APIs:** Riot Games API  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (testnet for MVP)  
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React)  
- **Backend:** Node.js  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. Users select upcoming matches from supported tournaments  
2. Place bets using on-chain transactions  
3. The smart contract resolves bets based on match results from Riot Games APIs  
4. Winners receive rewards automatically  

## 🛑 Security & Risks  
ArenaBet is **not audited** and should not be used for real-money betting. The smart contracts may have vulnerabilities, and API dependencies could affect reliability.  

## 🏗 Future Improvements  
- Multi-chain support  
- More game integrations beyond Riot Games  
- Enhanced security audits  
- Improved UI/UX for better user experience  

## 🎯 About This Project  
ArenaBet was created during the **ETHGlobal Brussels 2024 Hackathon** as an experimental Web3 betting platform. It showcases the potential of smart contract-based betting but is **not intended for real-world use**.
